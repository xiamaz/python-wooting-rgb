# Python Wooting RGB Bindings

This contains python wrappers for the Wooting RGB library.

In the future a higher level abstraction might also be provided.

## Installation

Install [Wooting RGB SDK](https://github.com/WootingKb/wooting-rgb-sdk) first.
Follow the instructions for your given platform.

Afterwards this library can be installed as a pip package.

## Usage

Import the `wooting_rgb_wrapper` for access to the low level bindings. These
directly map to the C functions with some additional wrapping of types.
